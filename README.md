# Authentication Setup in Next.js with Lucia Auth and Prisma

This guide demonstrates how to implement authentication in a Next.js application using [Lucia Auth](https://lucia-auth.com/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). It walks through setting up the project, building UI components for login and registration with [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs), configuring Lucia Auth with Prisma, and managing authentication actions.

## Project Setup

To start, you'll need to create a new Next.js application. After initializing the project, add the required dependencies for Lucia Auth, Prisma, and Shadcn to handle authentication and build user interfaces.

## Building UI Components with Shadcn

Utilize Shadcn to create user-friendly and accessible UI components for login and registration pages. This section covers how to design these forms and link them to authentication actions in the app.

## Configuring Lucia Auth with Prisma

Lucia Auth handles authentication seamlessly with Prisma as the database ORM. In this section, you will configure both to work together, setting up the connection to your database and integrating them with your Next.js app.

## Defining User and Session Models

You'll need to define your user and session models using Prisma. These models store user details and authentication sessions. This section details how to create and migrate these models in your database.

## Implementing Authentication Actions

This section explains how to implement core authentication actions, such as:

- User registration
- User login
- Session management

These actions interact with Lucia Auth to ensure secure user authentication.

## Handling Redirects Based on Authentication Status

Ensure a smooth user experience by managing redirects based on authentication status. This section covers how to redirect users to different pages (e.g., home, dashboard) based on their authentication state.

## Setting Up Routes and Components

Learn how to configure the necessary routes and components in your Next.js application to enable user interactions with the login and registration system.
